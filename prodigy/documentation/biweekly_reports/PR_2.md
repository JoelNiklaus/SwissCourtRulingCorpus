# Biweekly progress Report 2 (18.03.22)
## What did you work on the last two weeks?
### Prodigy
- Results are dumped into annotation.db, which is a sqlite Database
### Organisation
- Reading some related literature  on topic
- Getting more familiar with the workflow via docker (I'm slowly but surly getting the hang of it :D)
## What new things are working?
- We can dump the results into a extern DB
- Added a language parameter because we annotate all three languages
## What are you currently working on?
- How to chose the IDs and chache them?
- Add more parameter for the dimensions
- Getting the correct cases
- distingish between the students --> How does prodigy do the sessions? Saving session and continue where you started
- Reading prodigy documentation and developing the recipe for our specific case
- Still figuring out where I should save the annotated dataset
- Trying to display the metadata (ruling, judgments) for the law students annotation (we are only displaying the facts section for now)
- Reading more on topic
## What are your current struggles/problems?
- Some cases may not be that good because we chose shortest first
- Should we also annotate considerations, because some section splitting was no good
- LÃ¶sung mit kommentarfeld und dann diese ids einzeln entfernen?
- Run prodigy in background
## What could we do to help you overcome them?
- Where to dump the results, which column which table? de-> facts?
