# This file is intended to help develop the prodigy application.
# It runs a shell in the container, with all files mounted from the host to the container, allowing
# edits of all files in /prodigy to be made without restarting the container.
# Do not use this to actually run the server as it might corrupt a running operation.

# To develop the facts_annotation task please the following command
# prodigy facts-annotation test -F recipes/facts_annotation.py
# This runs the prodigy task on the test port, uses a test set as input and saves the annotation as a test set.
# Please do not run the recipe in the productive mode because the datasets are currently being annotated by the legal experts.
