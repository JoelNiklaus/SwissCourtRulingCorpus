# How to annotate the dataset using prodigy
This manual should help you to complete the annotation task described in the annotation Guidelines for the Explainability Annotations for Legal Judgment Prediction in Switzerland. 
For this task we used the tool [prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) and built a custom recipe which lets you annotate the facts section of a given court decision.
## Access
The prodigy instance can only be accessed via the University of Bern Network. If you want to annotate from home you must use the [VPN of the University of Bern](https://serviceportal.unibe.ch/sp?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=00cb11e51b005050134ddc6a9b4bcb49).
If you are connected to the University Network you can access prodigy via one of the following URLs:
- Angela: http://fdn-sandbox3.inf.unibe.ch:11001/
- Lynn: http://fdn-sandbox3.inf.unibe.ch:11002/
- Thomas: http://fdn-sandbox3.inf.unibe.ch:11003/
- FR-Annotations: http://fdn-sandbox3.inf.unibe.ch:12000/
- IT-Annotations: http://fdn-sandbox3.inf.unibe.ch:13000/

Before you can start you will be asked to provide a username and a password:
```
USERNAME: prodigy
PASSWORD: annotator
```
You should now see an overview of the case:
